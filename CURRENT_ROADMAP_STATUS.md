### ⏳ NEXT: Choose Your Path

You have 2 options:

---

## 🛤️ OPTION A: Build Real Business Messaging (RECOMMENDED) 
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks | **Revenue Impact**: HIGH | **Complexity**: MEDIUM

### What needs to be done:
1. **Backend Models** (Day 1-2)
   - Create `CustomerMessage` model
   - Create `MessageReply` model
   - Create migrations
   - Add to admin panel

2. **API Endpoints** (Day 3-4)
   - GET `/api/business/messages/` - List messages
   - GET `/api/business/messages/{id}/` - Single message
   - POST `/api/business/messages/{id}/reply/` - Send reply
   - PATCH `/api/business/messages/{id}/` - Mark read/archived

3. **Frontend Integration** (Day 5-7)
   - Replace mock Messages page with real data
   - Add reply form
   - Add unread badge to sidebar
   - Add message notifications

4. **Testing** (Day 8-10)
   - Unit tests for models
   - API endpoint tests
   - Integration tests
   - Frontend tests

**Why this is important**:
- ✅ Independent of Phase 2 AI work
- ✅ Revenue-enabling feature (customers can message sellers)
- ✅ Creates database foundation for Phase 2
- ✅ Customers can actually contact business owners about listings

---

## 🛤️ OPTION B: Start Phase 2 - Multi-Category AI Agent
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks | **Revenue Impact**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: HIGH

### What needs to be done:
1. **Phase 2: Classification Engine** (Week 1)
   - Write 15+ tests for classification
   - Implement `classification.py` module
   - Implement `tool_registry.py` module
   - Implement `feature_flags.py` utility

2. **Phase 3: Vector Store & Caching** (Week 2)
   - Setup vector database
   - Implement semantic search
   - Setup caching layers

3. **Phase 4: Worker Teams** (Week 3)
   - Create worker for Cars category
   - Create worker for Electronics
   - Create worker for Beauty/Fashion
   - Support 50+ categories

4. **Phase 5: Advanced Features** (Week 4)
   - CRAG (Corrective RAG) implementation
   - Human-in-the-Loop integration
   - Intelligent logging

5. **Phase 6: Polish & Deploy** (Week 5)
   - Load testing
   - Security audit
   - Performance optimization

**Why this takes longer**:
- ✅ Complex classification engine
- ✅ Multiple worker teams needed
- ✅ Vector database setup
- ✅ 30+ tests per phase
- ✅ Feature flag system

---

## 🎓 RECOMMENDED CHOICE

### **I Recommend: OPTION A + OPTION B (Hybrid)**

**Week 1: Business Messaging** (1-2 days effort)
- Build real message system
- Gets immediate ROI (customers can contact sellers)
- No dependencies on Phase 2

**Week 2-3: Phase 2 Foundations** (2-3 weeks)
- Classification engine
- Tool registry
- Feature flags
- RED GATE tests to ensure nothing breaks

**Why hybrid?**
1. ✅ Business messaging is **low effort, high ROI**
2. ✅ Can work on Phase 2 in parallel
3. ✅ Messaging becomes foundation for Phase 2
4. ✅ When Phase 2 "Contact Agent" button launches, message system already exists
5. ✅ Gets revenue started (customers → sellers communication)
