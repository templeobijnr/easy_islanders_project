# 🗺️ What's Next? - Complete Roadmap

## Current Status: ✅ Phase 0 & 1 COMPLETE

**34/38 tests passing (89%)**
**All core features working**
**Database deployed**
**API endpoints registered**

---

## 🎯 According to the Plan - Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

#### 1. **Create Frontend Components** ⭐ NEXT
**Status:** Not started
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Files:** `frontend/src/pages/CreateListing.jsx`

```jsx
// Frontend component for Phase 1
- Category selection dropdown (fetches from /api/categories/)
- Subcategory selection (fetches from /api/categories/<slug>/subcategories/)
- Dynamic form fields per category
- Image upload with preview
- Form validation
- Submit to /api/listings/
```

**Dependencies:** ✅ Already have API endpoints ready

---

#### 2. **Run RED GATE Tests** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Status:** Not started
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Purpose:** Verify existing property search still works

```bash
# RED GATE: Ensure ZERO breaking changes
pytest tests/test_existing_property_search_unchanged.py -v

# Must verify:
✅ Property search endpoints still work
✅ Existing listings still accessible
✅ Admin interface still functional
✅ All existing tests pass
```

**Why?** Guarantee no regressions before Phase 2

---

#### 3. **Document Deployment Steps**
**Status:** Not started
**Time:** 1 hour
**Files:** Create `DEPLOYMENT.md`

What to include:
- Environment setup (.env variables)
- Database migration commands
- Static files collection
- Running the server
- Testing in production-like environment

---

### Phase 2: Multi-Category AI Agent (Weeks 2-3)

#### Overview
Transform the AI agent to handle ANY product category, not just real estate.

#### Architecture
```
Current Agent: Property-specific (hardcoded)
    ↓
New Agent: Category-agnostic (smart classification)
    ├─ Classification Engine (detect intent)
    ├─ Tool Registry (route to correct tools)
    ├─ Feature Flags (safe rollout)
    ├─ Worker Teams (specialized agents)
    └─ RAG/CRAG (knowledge retrieval)
```

#### 2.1 Classification Engine 
**Time:** 4-5 hours
**Tests:** 15 tests
**Files:** 
- `assistant/brain/classification.py` (NEW)
- `tests/test_classification_engine.py` (NEW)

What it does:
- Detect if query is about cars, hotels, dining, electronics, etc.
- Use heuristics first (fast), LLM fallback (accurate)
- Return confidence score
- Log all classifications

```python
# Example
classify_query_heuristic("Show me 2-bedroom apartments")
# Returns: ("accommodation", 0.95)

classify_query_heuristic("I need a laptop under 500")
# Returns: ("electronics", 0.92)
```

#### 2.2 Tool Registry
**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Tests:** 8 tests
**Files:**
- `assistant/brain/tool_registry.py` (NEW)
- `tests/test_tool_registry.py` (NEW)

What it does:
- Register all available tools (search, filter, contact, etc.)
- Validate tool parameters
- Execute tools safely
- Log execution

```python
# Example
registry = ToolRegistry()
registry.register_tool(
    name="search_accommodation",
    category="accommodation",
    handler=search_accommodation
)
```

#### 2.3 Feature Flags
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Tests:** 6 tests
**Files:**
- `assistant/utils/feature_flags.py` (NEW)
- `tests/test_feature_flags.py` (NEW)

What it does:
- Enable/disable features by flag name
- Canary rollout (enable for X% of users)
- Per-user overrides
- Log all flag checks

```python
# Example
if is_feature_enabled("multi_category_agent", user):
    # Use new agent
else:
    # Use old agent
```

#### 2.4 RED GATE Protection
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Tests:** 8 tests
**Files:** `tests/test_redgate_protection.py` (NEW)

What it verifies:
```python
# Property search must ALWAYS work
test_property_search_still_works()
test_existing_listings_accessible()
test_photos_request_still_works()
test_contact_seller_still_works()
...
```

---

### Phase 3: Learn from Data (Weeks 3-4)

#### 3.1 Classification Analytics
- Collect all classification attempts
- Analyze failures
- Update heuristics based on real data

#### 3.2 Vector Store Integration
- Add embeddings for better classification
- Store product descriptions
- Enable semantic search

---

### Phase 4: Scale Safely (Weeks 4-5)

#### 4.1 Worker Teams
- Car Rental Agent (specialized)
- Restaurant Agent (specialized)
- Hotel Agent (specialized)
- Electronics Agent (specialized)
- General Agent (fallback)

#### 4.2 Tool Selection
- Route to correct tools per category
- Shared tools (contact, search generic)
- Category-specific tools

---

### Phase 5: Enterprise Features (Weeks 5-6)

#### 5.1 CRAG (Corrective RAG)
- Self-healing vector store
- Automatic query correction
- Relevance feedback

#### 5.2 Advanced Logging
- Trace every decision
- Audit trail for compliance
- Performance metrics
