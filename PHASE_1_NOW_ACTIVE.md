## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Step 1: Read Documentation (20 min)
1. Read this file (current)
2. Read `PHASE_1_QUICK_START.md` (5 min)
3. Read `PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (15 min)

### Step 2: Implement STEP 2 (BookingModal)
1. Create test file with 6 test cases
2. Run tests (will fail initially)
3. Implement component to pass tests
4. Verify all tests pass

### Step 3: Continue through STEP 7
- Follow same TDD workflow
- One step at a time
- Don't proceed until tests pass

---

## 🔧 TDD Workflow (For Each Step)

```
1. CREATE TESTS FIRST
   └─ Write test file with required test cases
   └─ Run tests (will fail - that's expected!)

2. IMPLEMENT COMPONENT
   └─ Write code to pass tests
   └─ Refine until all tests pass

3. VERIFY TESTS PASS
   └─ Run: npm test -- ComponentName.test.jsx
   └─ All tests should PASS ✅

4. COMMIT & MOVE TO NEXT STEP
   └─ Commit changes to git
   └─ Start next component
```

---

## 💻 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run BookingCalendar tests

## 🎓 Quality Standards

All code must:
- ✅ Pass all tests (TDD)
- ✅ Follow React best practices
- ✅ Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Be mobile-responsive
- ✅ Have proper error handling
- ✅ Be well-documented
- ✅ NOT break Phase 0 tests (35/35 must stay passing)

---

## 🚨 Important Rules

1. **One step at a time** - Don't skip steps
2. **TDD always** - Tests first, implementation second
3. **All tests must pass** - Don't proceed until 100% passing
4. **No regressions** - Phase 0 tests must stay passing
5. **Track progress** - Update PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md daily
6. **Commit often** - Commit after each step completion

---

## 📞 If You Get Stuck

1. Check `PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for requirements
2. Review test files to understand expectations
3. Look at STEP 1 (BookingCalendar) as reference
