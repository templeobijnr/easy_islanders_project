# Write 6 test cases
# Run tests (will fail - that's expected!)
npm test -- BookingModal.test.jsx
```

**2. Implement Component**
```jsx
// Create frontend/src/components/booking/BookingModal.jsx
// Write component code to pass all 6 tests
// Keep refining until all tests pass
```

```bash
npm test -- BookingModal.test.jsx
# All 6 tests should PASS ✅
